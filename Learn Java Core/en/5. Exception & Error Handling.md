### **Lesson 1: Understanding the Exception Hierarchy**

#### **1. Concept Explanation**

##### **What is an Exception?**
An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's instructions. When such an event occurs, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) creates an `Exception` object containing information about the error (like the type of error and the state of the program when it occurred) and "throws" it. This process stops the normal execution and begins searching for code that can handle the problem.

The primary purpose of exception handling is to separate the main business logic of a method from the code that handles exceptional, often unexpected, situations. This leads to cleaner, more readable, and more robust code.

##### **The `Throwable` Hierarchy**
In Java, all exceptions and errors are objects that inherit from the `java.lang.Throwable` class. This class is the root of the entire exception hierarchy. It has two direct subclasses: `Error` and `Exception`.

```
                  +-----------------+
                  |   java.lang.    |
                  |   Throwable     |
                  +-----------------+
                         /   \
                        /     \
              +-----------+   +---------------+
              |   Error   |   |   Exception   |
              +-----------+   +---------------+
                                   /       \
                                  /         \
                 +-------------------+   +--------------------+
                 |   Checked         |   |   RuntimeException |
                 |   Exceptions      |   |   (Unchecked)      |
                 | (e.g., IOException) |   | (e.g., NullPointer)|
                 +-------------------+   +--------------------+
```

##### **`Error` vs. `Exception`**

*   **`Error`:** Represents serious, abnormal problems that are external to the application and that a reasonable application should not try to catch. These are typically unrecoverable issues related to the JVM itself.
    *   **Examples:** `OutOfMemoryError` (the JVM has run out of memory), `StackOverflowError` (method calls are nested too deeply), `LinkageError`.
    *   **Rule:** You should almost never catch an `Error`. If one occurs, the best course of action is usually to let the program terminate and diagnose the underlying system-level problem.

*   **`Exception`:** Represents conditions that a reasonable application *might* want to catch and handle. These are problems that can occur during normal operation but are outside the immediate control of the program. The `Exception` class is further divided into two critical categories: checked and unchecked.

##### **Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions**

This is the most important distinction in Java's exception handling system.

1.  **Checked Exceptions:**
    *   **Definition:** All classes that inherit from `Exception` but **do not** inherit from `RuntimeException`.
    *   **Compiler Enforcement:** The Java compiler *checks* at compile time that you have handled these exceptions. You must either catch them in a `try-catch` block or declare that your method can throw them using the `throws` keyword in the method signature.
    *   **Purpose:** They represent expected, recoverable error conditions that are often external to the program logic, such as network failures (`SocketException`), file system errors (`IOException`), or database connectivity issues (`SQLException`). They force the programmer to think about and handle potential failure scenarios.

2.  **Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):**
    *   **Definition:** All classes that inherit from `RuntimeException`. `Error`s are also unchecked, but the term usually refers to `RuntimeException`s.
    *   **Compiler Enforcement:** The compiler does **not** check if you handle these. You are not required to use a `try-catch` block or a `throws` clause.
    *   **Purpose:** They typically represent **programming errors (bugs)**, such as logical flaws, improper use of an API, or other violations of preconditions.
    *   **Examples:** `NullPointerException` (trying to use a `null` reference), `IllegalArgumentException` (passing an invalid argument to a method), `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (accessing an array with an illegal index). The idea is that you should fix the code to prevent these from happening, rather than catching them.

---

#### **2. Example Code Snippet**

This example shows the compiler's different treatment of checked and unchecked exceptions.

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

public class ExceptionTypesDemo {

    // 1. Method dealing with a CHECKED exception
    // The compiler FORCES us to handle FileNotFoundException.
    // We choose to declare it with 'throws'.
    public static void readSomeFile(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException {
        // This line can throw a checked FileNotFoundException.
        FileReader reader = new FileReader(filename);
        System.out.println("File found and opened.");
        // ... file reading logic ...
    }

    // 2. Method dealing with an UNCHECKED exception
    // We are NOT required to declare NullPointerException.
    public static void printStringLength(String text) {
        // If 'text' is null, this line will throw an unchecked NullPointerException.
        System.out.println("Length is: " + text.length());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // We must handle the checked exception from readSomeFile()
        try {
            readSomeFile("my-file.txt");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("ERROR: The file was not found.");
        }

        // We are not forced to handle the potential unchecked exception.
        // This will crash the program if a null is passed.
        printStringLength(null);
    }
}
```

3.  `java.lang.InterruptedException`
4.  `java.lang.NumberFormatException`

*(Scroll down for the answer)*

...

**Answer:** B) `Error` typically represents unrecoverable system-level failures that should not be caught, while `Exception` represents conditions that an application might reasonably handle.

### **Lesson 2: `try-catch-finally` and Exception Propagation**

#### **1. Concept Explanation**

##### **The `try-catch-finally` Block**

This is the fundamental mechanism for handling exceptions in Java.

*   **`try` block:** Encloses the "guarded" code that might throw an exception. The JVM monitors this block.
*   **`catch` block:** This is the exception handler. It is executed only if an exception of a specified type (or its subtype) is thrown within the `try` block. You can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
*   **`finally` block:** This block is **always** executed, regardless of what happens in the `try` and `catch` blocks. It executes whether an exception was thrown or not, and whether a caught exception was handled or not.

**The primary use case for `finally` is resource cleanup.** It guarantees that critical cleanup code (like closing a file, a database connection, or a network socket) will run, preventing resource leaks.

**Execution Order Scenarios:**
1.  **No Exception:** `try` → `finally`. The `catch` block is skipped.
2.  **Exception Thrown and Caught:** `try` (stops at exception) → `catch` → `finally`.
3.  **Exception Thrown and Not Caught:** `try` (stops at exception) → `finally` → exception propagates up the call stack.
4.  **`try` or `catch` block has a `return` statement:** The `return` statement is prepared, then the `finally` block executes, and finally, the value is returned. **Crucial point:** If the `finally` block also has a `return` statement, it will *override* the return value from the `try` or `catch` block. This is considered very bad practice.

##### **Exception Propagation (Stack Unwinding)**

When a method throws an exception, the JVM's normal execution path is halted. The JVM then begins a process called **exception propagation** or **stack unwinding**.

1.  **Method Throws:** Method A throws an exception. The JVM immediately stops executing Method A.
2.  **Check for Handler:** The JVM checks if Method A has a `try-catch` block that can handle this specific exception type.
3.  **Unwind the Stack:**
    *   If no handler is found in Method A, the JVM terminates Method A and "unwinds" the call stack, returning to the point where Method A was called (e.g., in Method B).
    *   The process repeats: The JVM now checks if Method B has a suitable handler.
    *   This continues all the way up the call stack.
4.  **Program Termination:** If the exception propagates all the way up to the `main` method and is still not caught, the thread terminates, and the exception's stack trace is printed to the console.

**Diagram of Stack Unwinding:**
```
+---------------+
|   main()      |  <-- 3. Exception arrives here. No handler? Thread terminates.
+---------------+
       ^
       | calls
+---------------+
|   methodB()   |  <-- 2. No handler found. Unwind to main().
+---------------+
       ^
       | calls
+---------------+
|   methodA()   |  <-- 1. Exception is thrown. No handler found. Unwind to methodB().
+---------------+
```

##### **`throw` vs. `throws`**

These two keywords are often confused but have very different meanings.

*   **`throw`:** An **action**. It is used to actually throw an exception object. You use it inside a method body to signal that an exceptional condition has occurred.
    `throw new IllegalArgumentException("Amount must be positive.");`

*   **`throws`:** A **declaration**. It is used in a method signature to declare that the method *might* throw one or more checked exceptions. It is a warning to any code that calls this method that it must be prepared to handle those exceptions.
    `public void readFile() throws IOException, InterruptedException { ... }`

---

#### **2. Example Code Snippet**

This example demonstrates the execution flow of `try-catch-finally` and exception propagation.

```java
public class PropagationDemo {

    // Method 3: The source of the exception
    public static void performCalculation(int divisor) {
        System.out.println("Entering performCalculation...");
        if (divisor == 0) {
            // Unchecked exception is thrown here
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }
        System.out.println("Leaving performCalculation..."); // This line is skipped
    }

    // Method 2: Calls the problematic method but does not handle the exception
    public static void processData() {
        System.out.println("Entering processData...");
        try {
            performCalculation(0); // Exception propagates from here
        } finally {
            // This finally block WILL execute before the exception propagates further
            System.out.println("processData's finally block executed.");
        }
        System.out.println("Leaving processData..."); // This line is skipped
    }

    // Method 1 (main): Calls the processing method and handles the exception
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Entering main...");
        try {
            processData(); // Exception propagates to here
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            // The exception is finally caught and handled.
            System.out.println("CAUGHT in main: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("Leaving main...");
    }
}
```
**Output of the code:**
```
Entering main...
Entering processData...
Entering performCalculation...
processData's finally block executed.
CAUGHT in main: Division by zero
Leaving main...```

#### **3. Mini Exercise**

Create a method `int getNumber()` that can throw a custom checked exception `MyInputException`.
1.  Inside a `try` block, prompt the user to enter a number.
2.  If the input is not a valid integer, the parsing will throw a `NumberFormatException`. Catch this and `throw new MyInputException("Invalid input, not a number.");`.
3.  Add a `finally` block that prints "Finished attempting to read number."
4.  In your `main` method, call `getNumber()`. You will be forced to handle `MyInputException`.
5.  Run the program twice: once with a valid number and once with invalid text, and observe the execution path and output in both cases.

---

#### **4. Quiz Question**

**Question:** What is the output of the following code?
```java
public static int testFinally() {
    try {
        return 1;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return 2;
    } finally {
        return 3;
    }
}
// In main: System.out.println(testFinally());
```
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) It will not compile.

*(Scroll down for the answer)*

...

**Answer:** C) 3. This is a classic trick question. The `return 1` in the `try` block is prepared. However, before the method actually returns, the `finally` block **must** execute. Since the `finally` block also has a `return` statement, it "hijacks" the return process and the method immediately returns `3`. The original return value of `1` is discarded. This is why having a `return` statement in a `finally` block is a very bad practice.

### **Lesson 3: Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions - A Deeper Dive**

#### **1. Concept Explanation**

We've introduced the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions, but designing robust APIs requires a deeper understanding of the philosophy and trade-offs behind them. The decision of whether to make a custom exception checked or unchecked is a critical design choice.

##### **The Philosophy of Checked Exceptions**

*   **Forcing Recovery:** Checked exceptions are designed for conditions from which the program can often **realistically recover**. The compiler forces the calling code to confront the possibility of failure.
*   **API Contract:** Using a checked exception is a strong statement in your API's contract. You are telling your clients: "This operation can fail for this specific, predictable reason. You *must* have a plan to handle it."
*   **External Factors:** They are best used for failures that are outside the immediate control of the programmer's code, such as:
    *   File system issues (`IOException`)
    *   Network connection problems (`SocketException`)
    *   Database unavailability (`SQLException`)
    *   Invalid configuration (`MalformedURLException`)

**Pros:**
*   **API Documentation:** The `throws` clause clearly documents the potential failures of a method.
*   **Robustness:** Forces developers to build recovery and fallback logic, leading to more resilient applications.

**Cons:**
*   **Verbosity (Boilerplate):** Can lead to cluttered code with many `try-catch` blocks, especially if exceptions are not handled well at the right architectural layer.
*   **Leaky Abstractions:** If a low-level implementation detail (like an `SQLException`) is declared on a high-level business method, it "leaks" the implementation detail to the client. This is often solved by wrapping the checked exception in a custom unchecked exception.

##### **The Philosophy of Unchecked (Runtime) Exceptions**

*   **Indicating Bugs:** Unchecked exceptions are primarily for conditions that reflect **programming errors** or violations of a method's preconditions. They indicate a situation that the program cannot realistically recover from and should not be expected to. The problem should be fixed in the code.
*   **API Contract:** Using an unchecked exception is a statement in your API's contract that says: "If you use this method correctly, this exception will never happen. If it does, it's a bug in your calling code."
*   **Internal Factors:** They are best used for failures that are within the programmer's control, such as:
    *   Invalid arguments (`IllegalArgumentException`)
    *   Null parameters (`NullPointerException`)
    *   Illegal state (`IllegalStateException` - e.g., calling `connect()` on an already connected object)
    *   Array index errors (`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`)

**Pros:**
*   **Cleaner Code:** Avoids the clutter of `try-catch` blocks for errors that are fundamentally bugs.
*   **Fail-Fast:** Allows the program to crash close to the source of the bug, making it easier to identify and fix.

**Cons:**
*   **Hidden Dangers:** The compiler doesn't force you to handle them, so a potential failure might go unnoticed until it crashes the application in production.

##### **The Design Dilemma: "If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception."** - *Joshua Bloch, Effective Java*

This is the golden rule. Before creating a custom exception, ask yourself: "What can the calling code *actually do* if this happens?"
*   If the answer is "retry the operation, try a different server, or prompt the user for a new file path," it's a good candidate for a **checked exception**.
*   If the answer is "nothing, the input is invalid, this should never have happened, the only thing to do is log the error and crash," it should be an **unchecked exception**.

#### **2. Example Code Snippet: API Design Choice**

Imagine designing a simple bank account API.

##### **Scenario 1: Withdrawing money (A Recoverable Condition?)**
A user trying to withdraw more money than they have is a predictable, common event. The application can recover by showing a "Insufficient Funds" message. This makes it a good candidate for a custom **checked exception**.

```java
// A custom CHECKED exception
class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    private final double deficit;
    public InsufficientFundsException(String message, double deficit) {
        super(message);
        this.deficit = deficit;
    }
    public double getDeficit() { return deficit; }
}

class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    // ... constructor ...

    // The 'throws' clause is a clear part of the API contract.
    public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            // This is a programming error, not a recoverable condition.
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        }
        if (this.balance < amount) {
            // This is a recoverable condition.
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Insufficient funds", amount - this.balance);
        }
        this.balance -= amount;
    }
}

// Client code is FORCED to handle the recoverable error.
class BankApp {
    public void performWithdrawal(BankAccount account, double amount) {
        try {
            account.withdraw(amount);
            System.out.println("Withdrawal successful.");
        } catch (InsufficientFundsException e) {
            System.err.println("Transaction failed: " + e.getMessage());
            System.err.printf("You are short by $%.2f\n", e.getDeficit());
            // UI can now display a helpful message.
        }
    }
}
```

#### **3. Mini Exercise**

You are creating a `UserRegistry` class. It has a method `User findUserById(String id)`.
1.  Decide what should happen if no user with the given `id` is found.
    *   Should this be a checked or an unchecked exception?
    *   Justify your choice based on the "can the client recover?" principle. What could a client reasonably do in this situation?
2.  Create a custom exception for this scenario (e.g., `UserNotFoundException`).
3.  Implement the `findUserById` method in a mock `UserRegistry` class. If the user is not found, throw your new exception.
4.  In `main`, call this method and handle the exception appropriately based on whether you chose checked or unchecked.

---

#### **4. Quiz Question**

**Question:** Your method connects to a third-party payment gateway over the network. The connection might time out. This timeout is something the calling code could potentially handle by retrying the request a few seconds later. According to best practices, what type of exception should your method throw to signal this timeout?

A) A custom unchecked exception, like `PaymentGatewayTimeoutRuntimeException`.
B) `java.lang.Error`, because the network is an external system.
C) A standard `java.lang.RuntimeException`.
D) A custom checked exception, like `PaymentGatewayTimeoutException`.

*(Scroll down for the answer)*

...

**Answer:** D) A custom checked exception, like `PaymentGatewayTimeoutException`. A network timeout is a classic example of a recoverable, external condition. The client application can't prevent it, but it *can* reasonably be expected to have a recovery strategy (like retrying). Forcing the client to handle this with a checked exception leads to a more robust system.

### **Lesson 4: Custom Exceptions and Best Practices**

#### **1. Concept Explanation**

While Java provides a rich set of standard exception classes, they are often too generic to describe a specific failure in your application's domain. Creating your own **custom exception classes** is a powerful way to improve the clarity, readability, and maintainability of your error-handling code.

##### **Why Create Custom Exceptions?**

1.  **Specificity and Clarity:** A `UserNotFoundException` is far more descriptive than a generic `IllegalArgumentException`. It immediately tells the developer what went wrong.
2.  **Granular `catch` Blocks:** It allows clients to write specific `catch` blocks to handle your custom failure scenarios, separating them from other, more generic errors.
3.  **Carrying Extra Information:** You can add custom fields to your exception class to carry valuable contextual information about the failure. For example, an `InvalidOrderException` could carry the `orderId` and a list of validation errors.
4.  **Exception Chaining (Wrapping):** Custom exceptions are essential for the "exception translation" pattern, where you catch a low-level, implementation-specific exception (like `SQLException`) and re-throw it as a higher-level, application-specific exception (like `DataAccessException`).

##### **How to Create a Custom Exception**

Creating a custom exception is as simple as extending the appropriate superclass.

1.  **Choose the Superclass:**
    *   Extend **`Exception`** if you want to create a **checked exception**. Do this for recoverable, predictable failures that you want to force clients to handle (e.g., business rule violations like `InsufficientFundsException`).
    *   Extend **`RuntimeException`** if you want to create an **unchecked exception**. Do this for programming errors or violations of preconditions (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException` when an ID should have existed).

2.  **Follow Naming Conventions:** The class name should end with the suffix `Exception`.

3.  **Provide Standard Constructors:** It is a strong convention to provide the same four constructors that `Throwable` provides:
    *   A no-argument constructor.
    *   A constructor that accepts a `String message`.
    *   A constructor that accepts a `Throwable cause` (for exception chaining).
    *   A constructor that accepts both a `String message` and a `Throwable cause`.

##### **Exception Chaining**

Exception chaining is the practice of wrapping a caught exception inside a new, more specific exception. The original exception is called the "cause." This is crucial for not losing the root cause of a failure.

*   **Why?** It prevents low-level implementation details from leaking into higher layers of the application. The business layer shouldn't know or care about `SQLException`s; it should only care about a `DataAccessException`. By wrapping the `SQLException`, you hide the detail but preserve the original stack trace for debugging.
*   **How?** You pass the original exception (`e`) into the constructor of your new exception, which then calls `super(message, cause)`.

---

#### **2. Example Code Snippet: Custom Exception with Chaining**

This example demonstrates creating a custom checked exception that carries extra data and uses exception chaining.

```java
import java.sql.SQLException;

// 1. Create a custom CHECKED exception
public class DataAccessException extends Exception {

    // Custom field to carry extra context
    private final String sqlQuery;

    // 2. Provide the standard constructors
    public DataAccessException(String message, String sqlQuery) {
        super(message);
        this.sqlQuery = sqlQuery;
    }

    // Constructor for exception chaining
    public DataAccessException(String message, String sqlQuery, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause); // Pass the 'cause' to the superclass
        this.sqlQuery = sqlQuery;
    }

    public String getSqlQuery() {
        return sqlQuery;
    }
}

// Data Access Layer (Low-level)
class UserRepository {
    public void findUserById(String id) throws DataAccessException {
        String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + id + "'";
        try {
            // Simulate a database error
            throw new SQLException("Connection timeout");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // 3. Exception Chaining: Catch the low-level exception and wrap it.
            // Don't let SQLException leak out of this layer.
            throw new DataAccessException("Failed to execute user query", query, e);
        }
    }
}

// Service Layer (High-level)
public class UserService {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserRepository repo = new UserRepository();
        try {
            repo.findUserById("123");
        } catch (DataAccessException dae) {
            System.err.println("--- APPLICATION ERROR ---");
            System.err.println("Message: " + dae.getMessage());
            System.err.println("Failed Query: " + dae.getSqlQuery());

            // Get the original cause for debugging/logging
            Throwable cause = dae.getCause();
            if (cause != null) {
                System.err.println("Root Cause: " + cause.getMessage());
                // In a real app, you would log the full stack trace of the cause.
                // dae.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **3. Mini Exercise**

1.  Create a custom **unchecked** exception named `InvalidProductException`.
2.  This exception should extend `RuntimeException`.
3.  Add a `private final String productId` field to it.
4.  Provide a constructor that accepts a `message` and a `productId`.
5.  Create a `ProductValidator` class with a `static` method `void validate(Product product)`.
6.  The `validate` method should check if the product's price is negative. If it is, it should `throw new InvalidProductException("Price cannot be negative", product.getId())`.
7.  In `main`, create a product with a negative price and call the validator. Catch the exception and print out the custom message and the invalid `productId`.

#### **4. Quiz Question**

**Question:** Which of the following is the **least** appropriate reason to create a new custom exception class?

A) To provide more specific information about an error than a standard exception class allows.
B) To allow a client to catch your specific exception separately from other exceptions.
C) To make your code compile by satisfying a `throws` clause.
D) To wrap a lower-level exception to prevent leaking implementation details.

**Answer:** C) To make your code compile by satisfying a `throws` clause. While creating an exception class will satisfy the compiler, it's a very poor reason on its own. Often, this leads to bad practices like catching a broad exception and wrapping it just to "pass it up," without adding any value or context. Your decision should be driven by the need for clarity, specificity, and better API design, not just compiler appeasement.

### **Lesson 5: `try-with-resources` and Suppressed Exceptions**

#### **1. Concept Explanation**

##### **The Problem: Resource Leaks in `finally` Blocks**
Before Java 7, properly closing resources (like file streams, database connections, or network sockets) was verbose and surprisingly tricky. A `finally` block was required to guarantee that the `close()` method would be called.

**The Old, Verbose Way:**
```java
FileReader fr = null;
try {
    fr = new FileReader("file.txt");
    // ... do work with fr ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle error
} finally {
    // This is the cleanup block
    if (fr != null) {
        try {
            fr.close(); // The close() method itself can throw an IOException!
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // What do we do here? The original exception is more important.
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
This pattern has two main problems:
1.  **Boilerplate:** The code is ugly and distracts from the main logic.
2.  **Swallowed Exceptions:** If the code in the `try` block throws an exception, and the `fr.close()` in the `finally` block *also* throws an exception, the second exception from the `finally` block will be the one that propagates up the call stack. The original, more important exception from the `try` block is lost ("swallowed").

##### **The Solution: `try-with-resources`**
Java 7 introduced the `try-with-resources` statement to solve this problem elegantly. It automates the process of closing resources.

*   **`AutoCloseable` Interface:** The magic behind `try-with-resources` is the `java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface (and its sub-interface `java.io.Closeable`). This interface has a single method: `void close() throws Exception`. Any class that implements this interface can be used in a `try-with-resources` statement.

*   **Syntax:** You declare and initialize the resource in a set of parentheses `()` after the `try` keyword. You can declare multiple resources, separated by semicolons.
    ```java
    try (ResourceType resource1 = new ResourceType();
         ResourceType resource2 = new ResourceType()) {
        // ... use resource1 and resource2 ...
    } // resource2.close() and resource1.close() are called automatically here.
    ```
*   **How it Works Internally:** The compiler rewrites the `try-with-resources` block into a standard `try-finally` block. The `close()` calls are automatically placed inside the `finally` block in the reverse order of declaration. This guarantees that resources are closed even if an exception occurs.

##### **Suppressed Exceptions**
`try-with-resources` also solves the "swallowed exception" problem. If an exception is thrown from the `try` block, and *another* exception is thrown from the automatic `close()` call, the exception from the `try` block is the one that is propagated. The exception from the `close()` call is "suppressed" and attached to the primary exception.

You can then retrieve these suppressed exceptions using the `getSuppressed()` method on the caught exception. This ensures that you don't lose any information about what went wrong.

#### **2. Example Code Snippet**

This example creates a custom `AutoCloseable` resource to demonstrate the automatic closing and suppressed exception mechanism.

```java
// A custom resource that implements AutoCloseable
class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
    private final String name;

    public MyResource(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        System.out.println("Resource '" + name + "' created.");
    }

    public void doWork() {
        System.out.println("Resource '" + name + "' is doing work.");
        // Simulate an exception during work
        throw new RuntimeException("Error during work in " + name);
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        // This is the cleanup logic
        System.out.println("Resource '" + name + "' is closing.");
        // Simulate an exception during closing
        throw new Exception("Error while closing " + name);
    }
}

public class TryWithResourcesDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (MyResource res1 = new MyResource("Resource1");
             MyResource res2 = new MyResource("Resource2")) {
            res1.doWork();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("\n--- CAUGHT PRIMARY EXCEPTION ---");
            System.err.println("Primary Exception: " + e.getMessage());

            // Check for suppressed exceptions
            Throwable[] suppressed = e.getSuppressed();
            if (suppressed.length > 0) {
                System.err.println("\n--- SUPPRESSED EXCEPTIONS ---");
                for (Throwable t : suppressed) {
                    System.err.println("Suppressed: " + t.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Output of the code:**
```
Resource 'Resource1' created.
Resource 'Resource2' created.
Resource 'Resource1' is doing work.
Resource 'Resource2' is closing.
Resource 'Resource1' is closing.

--- CAUGHT PRIMARY EXCEPTION ---
Primary Exception: Error during work in Resource1

--- SUPPRESSED EXCEPTIONS ---
Suppressed: Error while closing Resource2
Suppressed: Error while closing Resource1
```
**Analysis:**
1.  Both resources are created.
2.  `res1.doWork()` throws the primary exception.
3.  The `try` block terminates.
4.  The `try-with-resources` mechanism attempts to close the resources. It calls `res2.close()` first (which throws an exception) and then `res1.close()` (which also throws one).
5.  The primary exception from `doWork()` is the one caught. The two exceptions from the `close()` calls are attached as suppressed exceptions. No information is lost.

#### **3. Mini Exercise**

1.  Use the standard Java library's `java.io.PrintWriter` and `java.io.FileWriter` classes.
2.  Write a method `void writeToFile(String filename, String text)` that writes a given text to a file.
3.  Implement this method using a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure that the `PrintWriter` (and its underlying `FileWriter`) are always closed.
4.  You will need to handle the `IOException` that `FileWriter`'s constructor and `PrintWriter`'s methods can throw.

#### **4. Quiz Question**

**Question:** In a `try-with-resources` block, in what order are the `close()` methods of the resources called?

A) In the same order they are declared in the `try()` statement.
B) In the reverse order they are declared in the `try()` statement.
C. The order is not guaranteed and depends on the JVM.
D) In parallel by multiple threads for efficiency.

*(Scroll down for the answer)*

...

**Answer:** B) In the reverse order they are declared in the `try()` statement. This is a deliberate design choice that mimics the unwinding of a stack. It ensures that resources that might depend on other resources are closed first (e.g., a `BufferedInputStream` is closed before the underlying `FileInputStream` it wraps).

### **Lesson 6: Topic Summary, Interview Questions, and Final Project**

This final lesson provides a consolidated summary of Java's exception and error handling mechanisms, highlights key interview questions to test your mastery, and presents a mini-project to apply these concepts in a practical, multi-layered application.

---

#### **1. Summary Table of Key Concepts**

| Concept | Key Takeaway & Best Practice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Throwable` Hierarchy** | `Throwable` is the root. `Error` is for unrecoverable system failures (don't catch). `Exception` is for application-level conditions. |
| **Checked Exceptions** | Subclasses of `Exception` (but not `RuntimeException`). Represent recoverable, external conditions. **Must be caught or declared (`throws`).** Use for predictable API failures (`IOException`, `SQLException`). |
| **Unchecked Exceptions** | Subclasses of `RuntimeException`. Represent programming errors/bugs. **Compiler does not enforce handling.** Use for precondition violations (`IllegalArgumentException`, `NullPointerException`). |
| **`try-catch-finally`** | `try` guards code. `catch` handles exceptions. `finally` *always* runs and is used for resource cleanup. Avoid `return` in a `finally` block. |
| **`throw` vs. `throws`** | `throw` is an action that throws an exception object. `throws` is a declaration in a method signature for checked exceptions. |
| **Exception Propagation** | If an exception is not caught in a method, the JVM unwinds the call stack, propagating the exception to the calling method until a handler is found or the thread terminates. |
| **Custom Exceptions** | Create your own by extending `Exception` (checked) or `RuntimeException` (unchecked). Use them to provide specific, meaningful error information relevant to your application's domain. |
| **Exception Chaining** | Wrapping a low-level exception inside a higher-level custom exception (`throw new DataAccessException(e)`). Preserves the root cause while hiding implementation details. |
| **`try-with-resources`** | The modern, preferred way to handle resources that implement `AutoCloseable`. Automatically calls `close()` and handles suppressed exceptions correctly, preventing resource leaks. |
| **Suppressed Exceptions** | In a `try-with-resources` block, if both the `try` block and the automatic `close()` call throw exceptions, the `close()` exception is "suppressed" and attached to the primary one. |

#### **2. Common Interview Questions**

1.  **"What is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception? Give an example of when you would use each."**
    *   *Answer:* A checked exception is enforced by the compiler; you must handle it or declare it. It's used for predictable, recoverable failures external to the code, like an `IOException` when a file is missing. An unchecked exception (a `RuntimeException`) is not enforced by the compiler and typically represents a programming bug. You would use it for precondition violations, like an `IllegalArgumentException` if a method receives a negative number when it expects a positive one.

2.  **"What is the purpose of the `finally` block? What happens if a `return` statement is present in both the `try` and `finally` blocks?"**
    *   *Answer:* The `finally` block's purpose is to guarantee the execution of cleanup code, like closing resources, regardless of whether an exception was thrown. If a `return` statement exists in both the `try` and `finally` blocks, the method will execute the `finally` block and its `return` statement will override the one from the `try` block. The value from the `try` block will be discarded. This is considered bad practice.

3.  **"Explain what `try-with-resources` is and what problem it solves."**
    *   *Answer:* `try-with-resources` is a statement that automatically manages the lifecycle of resources that implement the `AutoCloseable` interface. It solves two main problems with the traditional `try-finally` approach for resource management: it drastically reduces boilerplate code, and it correctly handles suppressed exceptions, preventing the original root cause of an error from being lost if another exception occurs during resource cleanup.

4.  **"When would you create a custom exception?"**
    *   *Answer:* You create a custom exception to model a specific failure scenario in your application's domain. This makes the code more readable and allows for more specific error handling. For example, a `UserNotFoundException` is more descriptive than a generic `Exception`. Custom exceptions can also carry extra contextual data (like an invalid order ID) to help diagnose the problem.

5.  **"Should you catch `Throwable`? Why or why not?"**
    *   *Answer:* No, you should almost never catch `Throwable`. `Throwable` is the superclass of both `Exception` and `Error`. Catching it means you are also attempting to handle `Error`s like `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError`, which are unrecoverable JVM-level failures that your application cannot and should not try to handle. Catching `Throwable` can mask serious problems and leave the application in an unstable state.

#### **3. Final Mini-Project: Layered Exception Handling in a File Parser**

This project will apply layered exception handling, custom exceptions, and `try-with-resources` to build a robust file parsing service.

**🎯 Goal:** Create a service that reads user data from a file, parses it, and validates it. The exception handling should be layered, meaning each component handles errors relevant to its level of abstraction.

**Project Components:**

1.  **Custom Exceptions:**
    *   `DataAccessException` (checked): For low-level problems reading the file (e.g., file not found). This will be used in the repository layer.
    *   `DataParsingException` (checked): For errors during the parsing stage (e.g., malformed lines). This will be used in the parser layer.
    *   `ValidationException` (unchecked): For business rule violations (e.g., an invalid email format). This represents a data quality bug, so it's unchecked.

2.  **Layer 1: `UserRepository` (Data Access Layer)**
    *   Create a class `UserRepository` with one method: `List<String> readLines(String filePath) throws DataAccessException`.
    *   This method should use `try-with-resources` with `java.nio.file.Files.newBufferedReader()` to read all lines from a file.
    *   If an `IOException` occurs, it should be **caught** and **wrapped** in a `DataAccessException`.

3.  **Layer 2: `UserParser` (Parsing Layer)**
    *   Create a class `UserParser` with one method: `User parseLine(String line) throws DataParsingException`.
    *   Assume a user line is a comma-separated string like `"123,Alice,alice@example.com"`.
    *   This method should split the string. If the line doesn't have exactly 3 parts, it should throw a `DataParsingException`.
    *   It should return a `User` object (a simple POJO with id, name, email).

4.  **Layer 3: `UserService` (Business Logic Layer)**
    *   Create a class `UserService` that uses the other two components.
    *   It will have one method: `List<User> processUsers(String filePath)`.
    *   This method will be the top-level entry point. It should orchestrate the process:
        *   Call the `UserRepository` to get the lines. It must handle the `DataAccessException`. If this occurs, it should log the error and return an empty list.
        *   Iterate through the lines and call `UserParser` for each one. It must handle the `DataParsingException`. If a line is malformed, it should log the error for that line and continue processing the next ones.
        *   After parsing, it should validate the `User` object (e.g., check if the email contains an "@" symbol). If validation fails, it should throw a `ValidationException` (since this is an unexpected data quality issue).

5.  **`Main` Class:**
    *   The `main` method will act as the client.
    *   It should call `userService.processUsers()` inside a `try-catch` block to handle the potential unchecked `ValidationException`.
    *   You will need to create a sample text file with some valid and some malformed lines to test all the exception paths.

This project structure forces you to think about which layer is responsible for which type of error, how to translate low-level exceptions into meaningful application-level exceptions, and when to recover versus when to fail fast.
